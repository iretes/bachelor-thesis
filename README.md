## Short abstract
This work presents a novel classification algorithm based on the concept of rank aggregation (RAC â€“ Rank Aggregation Classifier) that is particularly suitable for the classification of biological samples according to their gene expression profiles. RAC performance was compared with that of 5 other state-of-the-art classifiers, using as benchmarks 12 gene expression datasets and 3 image datasets. The results show that RAC performance is comparable to that of the other classifiers. Besides the good classification performance, RAC is also easily interpretable and has an intrinsic resilience to noise, features that could make it a useful support for diagnostic or prognostic purposes in the healthcare domain.
